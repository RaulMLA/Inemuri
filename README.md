# General info
It is important to note that the app has been designed and optimized for Android devices. While it may be possible to use the app on an iOS device, some of the web APIs used in the app may not work properly, which could lead to a degraded user experience or even prevent the app from working at all. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you use an Android device to ensure the best possible experience.

Additionally, please be aware that the app requires certain permissions to function properly, such as access to location data. It is important that you grant these permissions when prompted to do so in order to use the app correctly.

Finally, please note that the Inemuri App is intended for use as a tool to help you avoid sleeping near your public transport destination. It should not be relied upon as a substitute for responsible behavior, such as getting adequate sleep and planning your journey in advance. Always prioritize your own safety and well-being when using the app.
